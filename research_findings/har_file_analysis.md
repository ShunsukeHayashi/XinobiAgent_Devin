# Devin API HAR File Analysis

## Overview

This document provides an analysis of the Devin API based on the HAR file provided by the user. The HAR file contains network traffic captured during interactions with the Devin API, providing valuable insights into the API structure, authentication methods, and request/response patterns.

## API Structure

The HAR file confirms the API structure identified in our previous research:

1. **Base URL**: `https://api.devin.ai/v1`
2. **Authentication**: Bearer token authentication with the format `Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_TOKEN`
3. **Key Endpoints**:
   - `/sessions`: Create and list sessions
   - `/session/{session_id}`: Get session details
   - `/session/{session_id}/message`: Send messages to a session
   - `/attachments`: Upload file attachments
   - `/secrets`: List and manage secrets

## Additional Endpoints

The HAR file revealed additional endpoints not previously documented:

1. **Billing Usage**: `https://api.devin.ai/billing/usage/session/{session_id}`
   - Tracks usage metrics for a specific session
   - Used for billing and resource allocation

2. **Organization Repository Setup**: `https://api.devin.ai/org_{org_id}/repo-setup/pending-snapshot-upgrades`
   - Manages repository setup for organizations
   - Handles pending snapshot upgrades

3. **Resume Devin**: `https://api.devin.ai/resume-devin`
   - Resumes a paused Devin session
   - Used for session management and continuity

## Authentication Flow

The HAR file confirms the authentication flow:

1. API requests include the `Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_TOKEN` header
2. The API key is stored in the `DEVIN_API_KEY` environment variable
3. The client handles authentication token management

## DevinAPIClient Implementation

The HAR file contains a complete implementation of the `DevinAPIClient` class, which provides methods for all key API endpoints:

```python
class DevinAPIClient:
    def __init__(self, api_key=None, base_url="https://api.devin.ai/v1"):
        self.api_key = api_key or os.environ.get("DEVIN_API_KEY")
        if not self.api_key:
            raise ValueError("API key must be provided or set as DEVIN_API_KEY environment variable")
        
        self.base_url = base_url
        self.headers = {
            "Authorization": f"Bearer {self.api_key}",
            "Content-Type": "application/json"
        }
    
    def create_session(self, prompt, playbook_id=None):
        # Implementation
    
    def list_sessions(self, limit=10, offset=0):
        # Implementation
    
    def get_session(self, session_id):
        # Implementation
    
    def send_message(self, session_id, message):
        # Implementation
    
    def list_secrets(self):
        # Implementation
    
    def delete_secret(self, secret_id):
        # Implementation
    
    def upload_file(self, file_path):
        # Implementation
```

## Request/Response Patterns

The HAR file shows the following request/response patterns:

1. **Session Creation**:
   - Request: POST to `/sessions` with prompt and optional playbook_id
   - Response: Session details including session_id, status, and creation timestamp

2. **Message Exchange**:
   - Request: POST to `/session/{session_id}/message` with message content
   - Response: Message details including message_id, timestamp, and status

3. **File Upload**:
   - Request: POST to `/attachments` with multipart/form-data
   - Response: Attachment details including attachment_id and URL

## Security Considerations

The HAR file confirms the security considerations:

1. **API Key Management**:
   - API keys are stored in environment variables
   - Keys are never exposed in client-side code
   - Bearer token authentication is used for all requests

2. **Error Handling**:
   - Comprehensive error handling for API requests
   - Logging of errors for debugging
   - Proper exception handling for different error types

## Integration with XinobiAgent

The HAR file contains documentation on integrating Devin with the XinobiAgent framework:

1. **Template Conversion**:
   - Convert XinobiAgent templates to Devin-compatible prompts
   - Maintain visual formatting guidelines
   - Preserve intent structure and task breakdown

2. **Task Execution**:
   - Execute tasks defined in XinobiAgent format
   - Monitor progress and retrieve results
   - Provide feedback to the XinobiAgent framework

## Monitoring Approach

The HAR file confirms the monitoring approach:

1. **Chrome Extension**:
   - DevTools Panel for monitoring API interactions
   - Popup Interface for quick access
   - Background Monitoring for continuous tracking

2. **Developer Console Scripts**:
   - API Monitor for capturing requests and responses
   - Auth Monitor for tracking authentication events
   - Session Monitor for tracking session management

## Conclusion

The HAR file analysis confirms and extends our understanding of the Devin API structure, authentication methods, and request/response patterns. The findings align with our previous research and provide additional insights into the API implementation and integration patterns.

The analysis reveals a well-structured, RESTful API with comprehensive endpoint coverage, proper authentication, and robust error handling. The API is designed for easy integration with other frameworks like XinobiAgent and supports a wide range of use cases from simple task execution to complex multi-agent collaboration.
