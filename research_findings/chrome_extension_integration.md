# Chrome Extension Integration for Devin API Monitoring

## Overview

This document outlines the approach for creating a Chrome extension to monitor and analyze Devin API interactions. The extension will provide insights into how Devin operates by capturing API requests and responses.

## Chrome Extension Architecture

### Components

1. **Background Script**: Intercepts network requests to the Devin API
   - Uses `chrome.webRequest` API to monitor requests
   - Stores request and response data
   - Communicates with other extension components

2. **Content Script**: Runs in the context of web pages
   - Injects code to monitor XHR and fetch requests
   - Captures request and response data
   - Sends data to the background script

3. **DevTools Panel**: Provides a UI for analyzing requests
   - Displays request and response details
   - Allows filtering and searching of requests
   - Provides analysis of API usage

4. **Popup**: Provides quick access to statistics and actions
   - Shows monitoring status
   - Displays request statistics
   - Provides actions like clearing data and exporting

### Key APIs Used

1. **chrome.webRequest**: Intercepts network requests
   ```javascript
   chrome.webRequest.onBeforeRequest.addListener(
     function(details) {
       // Process request
     },
     { urls: ["https://api.devin.ai/v1/*"] },
     ["requestBody"]
   );
   ```

2. **chrome.devtools.panels**: Creates a panel in DevTools
   ```javascript
   chrome.devtools.panels.create(
     "Devin API",
     null,
     "panel.html",
     function(panel) {
       // Panel created
     }
   );
   ```

3. **chrome.runtime.sendMessage**: Communicates between components
   ```javascript
   chrome.runtime.sendMessage({
     action: "newRequest",
     request: requestData
   });
   ```

## Monitoring Approach

### API Request Interception

1. **Background Script Interception**:
   - Intercept all requests to `https://api.devin.ai/v1/*`
   - Extract request details (URL, method, headers, body)
   - Store request data

2. **XHR and Fetch Monitoring**:
   - Inject script to override `XMLHttpRequest` and `fetch`
   - Capture request and response data
   - Send data to background script

### Data Storage

1. **In-Memory Storage**:
   - Store requests and responses in memory
   - Group related requests and responses
   - Provide filtering and searching capabilities

2. **Export Functionality**:
   - Export captured data as JSON
   - Include request and response details
   - Include timing information

### Analysis Features

1. **Request Categorization**:
   - Categorize requests by endpoint
   - Identify session creation, message sending, etc.
   - Provide statistics by category

2. **Session Tracking**:
   - Track session creation and usage
   - Link related requests to the same session
   - Provide session-level analysis

3. **Timing Analysis**:
   - Measure request duration
   - Identify slow requests
   - Provide timing statistics

## Integration with Developer Console

### DevTools Panel

1. **Panel Creation**:
   - Create a custom panel in DevTools
   - Provide a UI for analyzing requests
   - Include filtering and searching capabilities

2. **Network Request Sidebar**:
   - Add a sidebar to the Network panel
   - Show Devin API requests
   - Provide quick access to request details

### Console Integration

1. **Console Logging**:
   - Log Devin API requests to the console
   - Include request and response details
   - Format logs for readability

2. **Custom Console Commands**:
   - Add custom commands to the console
   - Allow querying of captured requests
   - Provide analysis through the console

## Implementation Considerations

### Performance

1. **Efficient Data Storage**:
   - Limit the number of stored requests
   - Implement pagination for large datasets
   - Optimize data structures for quick access

2. **Minimal Overhead**:
   - Minimize impact on page performance
   - Use efficient event listeners
   - Avoid unnecessary processing

### Security

1. **API Key Protection**:
   - Do not store API keys
   - Redact sensitive information in logs
   - Implement secure export functionality

2. **Data Privacy**:
   - Respect user privacy
   - Only capture Devin API requests
   - Provide clear information about data usage

### User Experience

1. **Intuitive UI**:
   - Provide a clean and intuitive interface
   - Use consistent design patterns
   - Include helpful tooltips and documentation

2. **Responsive Design**:
   - Ensure the UI works well at different sizes
   - Implement responsive layouts
   - Support different DevTools themes

## Conclusion

The Chrome extension for Devin API monitoring will provide valuable insights into how Devin operates by capturing and analyzing API interactions. By integrating with the Developer Console, it will offer a powerful tool for understanding Devin's capabilities and behavior.
