# Devin API Monitoring: Final Report

## Executive Summary

This report presents the findings of our comprehensive analysis of the Devin API using Chrome extension integration and Developer Console monitoring. We have successfully developed and tested monitoring solutions that provide detailed insights into Devin's API interactions, authentication flow, and session management.

The monitoring solutions include:
1. A Chrome extension for real-time monitoring of Devin API interactions
2. Developer Console scripts for on-demand monitoring without extension installation
3. A testing environment with mock server for simulating Devin API interactions

Our analysis confirms that Devin uses a RESTful API structure with Bearer token authentication and maintains session state across interactions. The monitoring solutions provide comprehensive capabilities for capturing and analyzing API requests, authentication events, and session management.

## Key Findings

### API Structure

The Devin API follows a RESTful structure with the following key endpoints:

1. **Authentication**:
   - Authentication endpoint for obtaining tokens
   - Authentication uses Bearer token format in the Authorization header

2. **Session Management**:
   - Endpoints for creating new sessions
   - Endpoints for retrieving session details
   - Sessions maintain state across requests with unique IDs, timestamps, and message history

3. **Message Exchange**:
   - Endpoints for sending messages to a session
   - Messages include ID, content, timestamp, and role (user/assistant)

4. **File Attachments**:
   - Endpoints for uploading file attachments
   - Attachments are referenced by ID in messages

### Authentication Flow

1. Client requests authentication token
2. Server returns token with expiration time
3. Client includes token in Authorization header for subsequent requests
4. Token is refreshed when expired

### Session Lifecycle

1. Client creates session with initial prompt
2. Server returns session ID and status
3. Client sends messages to session
4. Server processes messages and returns responses
5. Session maintains state across interactions

### Message Exchange Pattern

1. Client sends message to session with content
2. Server processes message and updates session state
3. Server returns success status
4. Client retrieves updated session details including new messages
5. Messages are ordered chronologically within session

## Monitoring Solutions

### Chrome Extension

The Chrome extension provides:

1. **DevTools Panel**: A dedicated panel in Chrome DevTools for monitoring Devin API interactions
2. **Popup Interface**: A popup interface for quick access to monitoring data
3. **Background Monitoring**: Continuous monitoring in the background
4. **Network Request Filtering**: Filtering of network requests to focus on Devin API calls
5. **Visual Data Presentation**: Visual presentation of monitoring data

Key components:
- Background script for monitoring network requests
- DevTools integration
- DevTools panel implementation
- Popup interface implementation
- Network request monitoring
- Console output monitoring

### Developer Console Scripts

The Developer Console scripts provide:

1. **API Monitor**: Captures API requests and responses
2. **Auth Monitor**: Monitors authentication events and token usage
3. **Session Monitor**: Tracks session creation, updates, and message exchanges
4. **Combined Monitor**: Integrates all monitoring functionalities

Key features:
- Request interception through fetch and XMLHttpRequest overrides
- Token masking for security
- Session tracking and analysis
- Comprehensive data export

### Testing Environment

The testing environment includes:

1. **Mock Server**: Server simulating API endpoints
2. **Test Client**: Application for loading monitoring scripts and running test scenarios
3. **Test Scenarios**: Predefined scenarios for testing monitoring capabilities

Key components:
- Mock server implementing API endpoints
- Test client for loading monitoring scripts and running test scenarios
- JavaScript module defining test scenarios
