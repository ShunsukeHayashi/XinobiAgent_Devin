## Implementation Components

### Agent System
- **BaseAgent**: Abstract class that defines the agent interface
- **GenericAgent**: Implementation of the Working Backwards methodology

### API Layer
- **EnhancedDevinAPIClient**: Client for the Enhanced Devin API
- **MockDevinAPIClient**: Mock client for testing without an API key

### Tool System
- **BaseTool**: Abstract class that defines the tool interface
- **BashTool**: Tool for executing bash commands
- **PythonExecuteTool**: Tool for executing Python code
- **GoogleSearchTool**: Tool for searching the web

### Monitoring System
- **APIMonitor**: Monitors API requests and responses
- **PerformanceMonitor**: Monitors system performance
