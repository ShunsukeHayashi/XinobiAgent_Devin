- **Custom Tools**: Support for custom tool development

### Monitoring System

The Monitoring System provides visibility into system operation and performance. It includes:

- **APIMonitor**: Monitoring of API requests and responses
- **PerformanceMonitor**: Monitoring of system performance
- **DebugTracer**: Tracing of execution for debugging
- **EventLogger**: Logging of events for monitoring

## Gradio UI

The Gradio UI provides a web-based interface for interacting with Enhanced Devin. It includes:

- **Session Management**: Creation and management of sessions
- **Chat Interface**: Sending and receiving messages
- **Tool Execution**: Execution of tools
- **Monitoring Dashboard**: Monitoring of system operation

### UI Components

The Gradio UI provides the following components:

- **Sessions Tab**: Create and manage sessions
- **Chat Tab**: Send messages, upload files, and view responses
- **Tools Tab**: Execute tools and view tool details
- **Monitoring Tab**: View API requests, performance metrics, and logs

### Method Handlers

The method handlers connect the UI components to the Enhanced Devin system:

- **API Key Management**: Set and validate API keys
- **Session Handling**: Create, load, and manage sessions
- **Message Processing**: Send messages and process responses
- **Tool Execution**: Execute tools and process results

### Integration

The integration connects to the Enhanced Devin system through:

- **API Client**: Communicate with the Enhanced Devin API
- **Tool Registry**: Access and manage tools
- **Agent System**: Interact with the agent system
- **Monitoring System**: Access monitoring data

## Implementation

The implementation follows a phased approach:

1. **Core Framework**: Basic implementation of the core components
2. **Advanced Agent Capabilities**: Enhanced agent capabilities
3. **Advanced Tool System**: Enhanced tool system
4. **Extended API Capabilities**: Enhanced API capabilities
5. **Monitoring and Analytics**: Enhanced monitoring and analytics
6. **Integration and Testing**: Integration of all components and testing

## Usage

To use Enhanced Devin, you can:

1. **Use the Gradio UI**: Interact with Enhanced Devin through the web-based interface
2. **Use the API**: Interact with Enhanced Devin through the API
3. **Use the Command Line**: Interact with Enhanced Devin through the command line

### Running the Gradio UI

python enhanced_devin/ui/run_ui.py --share

# Using the launcher
python enhanced_devin/ui/launcher.py --share

# Using the test integration script
python enhanced_devin/ui/test_integration.py --share

# Using the public URL script
python run_gradio_ui_with_public_url.py
```

### UI Features

The UI provides the following features:

- **Session Management**: Create and manage sessions
- **Chat Interface**: Send messages, upload files, and view responses
- **Tool Execution**: Execute tools and view tool details
- **Monitoring Dashboard**: View API requests, performance metrics, and logs

## Testing

The implementation has been tested with the following:

- **Unit Tests**: Testing of individual components
- **Integration Tests**: Testing of component integration
- **UI Tests**: Testing of the Gradio UI
- **End-to-End Tests**: Testing of the entire system
