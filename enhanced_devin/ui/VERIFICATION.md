## Prerequisites

Before verifying the Enhanced Devin UI, make sure you have:

- Installed all required dependencies (see INSTALLATION.md)
- Set up the environment (see INSTALLATION.md)

## Verification Steps

### 1. Start the UI

```bash
python run_simple_gradio_ui.py --debug
```

The `--debug` flag enables debug mode, which provides more detailed logging information.

### 2. Verify the UI is Running

You should see output similar to:

```
Starting Simple Enhanced Devin UI on port 7860
Running on local URL:  http://0.0.0.0:7860
```

### 3. Open the UI in a Browser

Open a web browser and navigate to:

```
http://localhost:7860
```

You should see the Enhanced Devin UI with the following components:

- Header with "Enhanced Devin" title
- API Key input field
- Session management section
- Chat interface
- Agent actions panel

### 4. Test Session Creation

1. Enter a name for the session (e.g., "Test Session")
2. Click "Create Session"
3. Verify that the session appears in the "Active Sessions" dropdown

### 5. Test Message Sending

1. Type a message in the "Message" field (e.g., "Hello, Enhanced Devin!")
2. Click "Send Message"
3. Verify that the message appears in the chat history
4. Verify that the agent responds with a message
5. Verify that the agent actions panel shows the actions taken by the agent

### 6. Test File Upload

1. Prepare a small text file for testing
2. Click "Upload File" and select the test file
3. Type a message related to the file (e.g., "Please analyze this file")
4. Click "Send Message"
5. Verify that the agent acknowledges the file upload

### 7. Test Public URL Sharing

1. Restart the UI with the `--share` option:
   ```bash
   python run_simple_gradio_ui.py --share
   ```
2. Verify that a public URL is generated (it will be displayed in the console)
3. Open the public URL in a browser and verify that the UI works correctly
